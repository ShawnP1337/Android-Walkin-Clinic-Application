## Introduction
We were tasked with creating an application for a walk-in clinic for the use of the patients attending the clinic, as well as the employees that worked there. Through the use of tools such as  Android Studio and GitHub, we were able to produce the following application represented in this GitHub repository, which can create multiple different accounts for both patients and employees, create and assign services, manage profiles and clinic details, book appointments, a d rate clinics.

## Lessons Learned

This course has introduced us to the world of software development and the process that goes into creating an application. We have learned how to use Android Studio for the production of the applications functionalities, and GitHub for the tracking of the development process. Introduction to Android Studio and databases incremented our knowledge of coding, and made us more fluent in Java. We were shown a glimpse into real-world scenarios for software development, such as encountering problems and working as a team to solve them. Communicating effectively and delegating work was a large factor in the development process, achieving assigned tasks that accumulated into the final product was a big lesson to take away from this course, and is something that can be improved in the future. This course has given us experience that can be applied well to jobs in the software field, where working as a team is extremely important to achieve a goal.
