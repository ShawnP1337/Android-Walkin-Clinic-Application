### Deliverable 4:
This dev design offers the patient functionality of the app.
The patient can now search for a clinic that has been created by the employee either through an address, hours of operation, and services. The Patient can book an appointment with a clinic and the appointment is stored in the database. UPDATE: If two or more employees belong to the same clinic(have the same clinic name registered in their profile) then both employees will be able to edit the services and hours of the clinic and the changes will reflect in the others profile. To create a clinic an employee MUST fill out their profile, once a clinic name has been added, a clinic then is created in the database.
