## OVERVIEW
### Deliverable 1:
This dev design offers a login page, a registration page, and respective role pages (Admin, Employee, Patient) which allow a user to create an account if they do not already have one and sign into their respective role page. The Database used to hold all account information is desgined and written using SQLite, all passwords are hashed using SHA-256 hashing.

### Deliverable 2:
This dev design offers the admin functionality of the app. The admin user can now manage all services and users within the databse, the admin can add,edit or delete either a service or a user account. A RecyclerView is used (under ViewServices or ViewUsers button) to allow the admin to locate and verify that certain actions have taken place such as add, edit, or delete.

### Deliverable 4:
This dev design offers the patient functionality of the app.
The patient can now search for a clinic that has been created by the employee either through an address, hours of operation, and services. The Patient can book an appointment with a clinic and the appointment is stored in the database. UPDATE: If two or more employees belong to the same clinic(have the same clinic name registered in their profile) then both employees will be able to edit the services and hours of the clinic and the changes will reflect in the others profile. To create a clinic an employee MUST fill out their profile, once a clinic name has been added, a clinic then is created in the database.
